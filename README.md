# Ethan's AI/ML Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a high school senior with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and solving real-world problems through code.

This portfolio showcases the projects I‚Äôve built independently using Python, ML libraries, and public datasets. It‚Äôs a reflection of my curiosity, technical growth, and drive to become an AI/ML Engineer.
